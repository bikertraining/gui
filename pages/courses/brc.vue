                    <li>This course is designed for beginning riders of all ages. The Basic RiderCourse consists of 15
                        hours of instruction including approximately 5 hours using the online self-paced eCourse and 10
                        hours of riding on the parking lot range. This course will teach you how to operate a motorcycle
                        safely, and strongly emphasizes the special skills and mental attitude required for dealing with
                        every day riding.
                    </li>

                    <li class="mt-3 fw-bold">You must be able to ride a two-wheeled bicycle to enroll in the BRC.</li>

                    <li class="mt-3">You will learn about different types of motorcycles, their controls, and how they
                        operate. The Rider Coaches, all experienced professionals, will advise you on the proper riding
                        gear to ensure comfort and protection. You will also learn how alcohol and other drugs affect
                        your ability to ride safely.
                    </li>

                    <li class="mt-3">The range is a controlled, off-street, pedestrian-free environment. Students use
                        motorcycles provided by the school to learn and practice safely and correctly the various
                        maneuvers and demanding situations encountered in street riding. Riders must pass both a written
                        test and a riding skills test in order to complete the course. Upon successful completion, you
                        will be exempt from any requirement to take the State test for your motorcycle endorsement at
                        the driver's license office.
                    </li>

                    <li class="mt-3 fw-bold">This course meets the State of Florida requirement for obtaining a
                        motorcycle endorsement on your driverâ€™s license. All students must wear the required protective
                        gear.

                        You must attend all class/range sessions. If you miss a class or range session or for any reason
                        do not fully complete your class, you can purchase a seat in a subsequent class for
